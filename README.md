### Point Bi-serial Correlation Coefficient

$r_{pb} = \frac{\overline{Y_0} - \overline{Y_1}}{s_x} \sqrt{ p_0p_1}$

* When $r_{pb}$ is closer to 0, X and Y are not associated.
* When $r_{pb}$ is closer to $\pm1$, X and Y are strongly associated.


| Variable         | Description                                                                             |

| $s_x$            | Standard deviation of numerical variable                                                |
| $\overline{Y_0}$ | Mean value of group of data associated with 0                                           |
| $\overline{Y_1}$ | Mean value of group of data associated with 1                                           |
| $p_0$            | $\frac{\text{no. of observations associated with 0}}{\text{total no. of observations}}$ |
| $p_1$            | $\frac{\text{no. of observations associated with 1}}{\text{total no. of observations}}$ |


### Alternate formula for Sample Variance

$$
\text{Sample Variance} = \frac{\Sigma x^2 - \frac{(\Sigma x)^2}{n}}{n-1} = \frac{\Sigma x^2 - n.\overline{x}^2}{n-1}
$$
